                I now realize that its completely impossible to get quality work
                done with less than 4 hours of sleep 3 days in a row. Watch out
                as you will make dumb mistakes without that REM-goodness.

                Be carful operating a vehicle in a sleep-deprived state! Be even
                more carful when operating a code editor in such a state! ;)

                Watching tutorials and following examples in class are great
                ways to learn new concepts, but if you want that newly minted
                information to still be in your head three days (or three hours)
                later....PRACTICE!
              </p>
              <p>
                It might seem obvious, but it bears repeating here. For the
                longest time I was following online video tutorials but nothing
                ever seemed to stick.
              </p>
              <p>
                Taking what you learn in a video and practicing that concept in
                your own way is what made concepts start to stick for me. If you
                want to up your retention even more, the best way (other than
                more practice) it to help others learn. When explaining a
                concept to someone else, you'll realise your own short-comings
                very quickly.

                CSS Media Queries are AWESOME
              </div>

              <p>
                The first time I used media queries in CSS my mind was blown! If
                you're unfamiliar, media queries allow you to conditionally
                apply CSS stylings. The most widely used condition to check is
                the width of the user's screen. <br />
                If you want a responsive site, media queries are essential.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>@media screen and (max-width: 800px) { }</strong><br />
                With this one simple line you can have styling (code goes in {}
                ) that will only apply when the user's screen is 800px or less.
                <br />
                This is a very common way of using media queries, however there
                are many other conditions to check for. <br />

                I shouldn't be surprised, but I am. With just over three weeks
                left of term life is crazy trying to keep up! I'm sure many
                readers can sympathize. Just three weeks to go though! The light
                at the end of the tunnel is in sight.
